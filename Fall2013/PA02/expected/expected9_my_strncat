1.  .
Half a league, half a league,  .
Half a league onward,  .
All in the valley of Death  .
Rode the six hundred.  .
2.  .
"Forward, the Light Brigade!  .
"Charge for the guns!" he said:  .
Into the valley of Death  .
Rode the six hundred.  .
"Forward, the Light Brigade!"  .
Was there a man dismay'd?  .
Not tho' the soldier knew  .
Someone had blunder'd:  .
Theirs not to make reply,  .
Theirs not to reason why,  .
Theirs but to do and die:  .
Into the valley of Death  .
Rode the six hundred.  .
3.  .
Cannon to right of them,  .
Cannon to left of them,  .
Cannon in front of them  .
Volley'd and thunder'd;  .
Storm'd at with shot and shell,  .
Boldly they rode and well,  .
Into the jaws of Death,  .
Into the mouth of Hell  .
Rode the six hundred.  .
4.  .
Flash'd all their sabres bare,  .
Flash'd as they turn'd in air,  .
Sabring the gunners there,  .
Charging an army, while  .
All the world wonder'd:  .
Plunged in the battery-smoke  .
Right thro' the line they broke;  .
Cossack and Russian  .
Reel'd from the sabre stroke  .
Shatter'd and sunder'd.  .
Then they rode back, but not  .
Not the six hundred.  .
5.  .
Cannon to right of them,  .
Cannon to left of them,  .
Cannon behind them  .
Volley'd and thunder'd;  .
Storm'd at with shot and shell,  .
While horse and hero fell,  .
They that had fought so well  .
Came thro' the jaws of Death  .
Back from the mouth of Hell,  .
All that was left of them,  .
Left of six hundred.  .
6.  .
When can their glory fade?  .
O the wild charge they made!  .
All the world wondered.  .
Honor the charge they made,  .
Honor the Light Brigade,  .
Noble six hundred.  .
