I know you're out there.  .
I can feel you now.  .
I know that you're afraid.  .
You're afraid of us.  .
You're afraid of change.  .
I don't know the future.  .
I didn't come here to tell you how this is going to end.  .
I came here to tell you how it's going to begin.  .
I'm going to hang up this phone, and then I'm going to show these people what you don't want them to see.  .
I'm going to show them a world... without you.  .
A world without rules and controls, without borders or boundaries; a world where anything is possible.  .
Where we go from there is a choice I leave to you.  .
