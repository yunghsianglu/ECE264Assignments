ECE 264 - SPRING 2013 - PROGRAMMING ASSIGNMENT 13
------------------------------------------------------------------

In this assignment, you need to write README explaining how you
solve the problem.  You should write README and comments before
writing code.

INTRODUCTION
============

PARALLEL PROGRAMMING
==========

Due to Moore's Law, we are reaching the limits of being able to reduce 
the size of transistors in order to raise processor speeds.  In order 
to continue to see improvement in computing performance, more and more
systems are using multiple cores that can be programmed to run code in
parallel. One way that is done are pthreads(POSIX thread). POSIX means Portable Operating System Interface; it is a standard for the programming interface of operating systems.

ASSIGNMENT
==========

Write a parallel C program that returns the answer for the following problem:

Given a nonempty set S, with elements {a1, a2, a3, ...}, and a integer N, 
find the number of nonempty subsets of S, such that the sum of all elements 
in this subset equals to N.

This problem is NP-complete, meaning that currently there is no way 
to sovle it efficiently. However, since this assignment is targeted for 
parallel computing, the algorithm is not an important part. 
You only need to take the simplest approach: 
enumerate all the subset of S,  add up the elements and compare to N, 
count one if there is a match, and finally return the total number of counts.

In this assignment, you need to submit the following files:

README
subsetSum.c

You should write the function subsetSum() in subsetSum.c file and submit it.
You may write your additional functions or structure inside subsetSum.c file.
Please do not modify the other files. 

In this assignment, you should be aware of the Thread Synchronization.
Please refer to the following explanation.

Thread Synchronization: 
With multiple threads running in parallel updating a shared variable can 
potentially cause corruption of data. Therefore there needs to be some 
mechanism to guarantee that only one thread can update the shared variable 
at a time. Such process is termed as Thread Synchronization, referring to 
the fact that each thread needs to suspend its execution to form an 
agreement on how to access a shared resource, in order to gurantee integrity 
of the data. The code that accesses the shared resource that must not be 
access by two or more threads is called the critical section.

In pthread the synchronization process is done by protecting the critical 
sections by using mutex objects. Mutex refers to mutual exclusion, 
which means no two threads can have controll over the object at the same time. 
A mutex object has two states, locked and unlocked. A thread first has to 
lock the mutext object in order to access the shared resource protected by 
the mutex. After it acquires the lock, it can step further to execute the 
critical section that access shared resources. A mutex object that is locked 
cannot be locked again, and only the thread acquired the lock can unlock it 
at any given time. If it is locked, other threads must wait for the owner 
of the lock to finish.  When the thread finishes access to shared resources, 
it unlocks the mutex object and only by then can the other threads acquire 
the lock. This way ensures only one thread gets to access the common resource 
at any given time, therefore the threads are sychronized, and data integrity 
is guaranteed.


SPECIFICATIONS
==============

* You should use the following print statement if the dynamic memory
  is not allocated properly (and exit with EXIT_FAILURE):
  printf("Unable to allocate memory!\n");

* The source files (argv[1], and argv[2]), the destination file (argv[3]), 
  and the number of parallel thread you want to run (argv[4]) are 
  command-line arguments.



COMPILING AND EXECUTING
=======================

Warning messages are often indications of errors. For this assignment,
you lose 0.1 point for each warning message. The command will generate
an executable file called "pa13."

To execute this program, type

  ./pa13 <input_set> <input_num> <output> <number of threads>


You need to use you ece264 account to login into quatro01 or quatro02
to run your program. 

A couple of the testcases are quite large.  Running them may cause
you to use all of the disk space.  Be sure to check your space by typing
'quota'. 


MEMORY MANAGEMENT
=================

Memory management (allocation and release) is an important part of ECE
264. You have to allocate enough memory to make your program work. You
have to allocate and release memory as needed. You are not allowed to
allocate a large piece of memory regardless of the input size. We will
restrict stack size to prevent that. You will receive a heavy penalty
(50%) if your program does not release all memory (i.e. memory
leak). We will use valgrind to check for memory leaks.


GRADING
=======

The maximum score for this exercise is 4.0 points.  

We will first examine the correctness of your code.  After checking 
correctness, we will then examine the runtimes of your code.  If your 
code runs slower than the maximum allowed runtime, you will lose points 
in proportion with how much longer the runtime.  Since multiple people 
may be running on the quatro machines, it is possible that the runtime
of your program may be slower than it should be.  If you feel that your program is faster than what is being reported, execute your program at
another time.
