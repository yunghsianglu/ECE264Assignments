// ~ Binary (Search) Trees ~ //

From Wikipedia: A binary tree is a tree data structure in which each
node has at most two children (referred to as the left child and the
right child).

This is similar (and more general) to "linked lists", where nodes have
at most one child.

Linked List:
    O   head/tail   O   head        O   head        O   head
                    |               |               |
                    V               V               V
                    O   tail        O               O
                                    |               |
                                    V               V
                                    O   tail        O
                                                    |
                                                    V
                                                    O   tail

Binary Tree:
    O   root        O   root       O   root            O   root
                   / \           /   \              /     \
                  O   O         O     O          O           O
                left right     / \   / \       /   \       /   \
                              O   O O   O     O     O     O     O
                                             / \   / \   / \   / \
                                            O   O O   O O   O O   O

The above diagrams show *full* binary trees, where every node has
either zero or two children. It is perfectly acceptable to have a node
with one child somewhere in the tree:

More Binary Trees:
    O   root        O   root       O   root       O   root
                   / \            / \            / \
                  O   O          O   O          O   O
                       \        /                \   \
                        O      O                  O   O
      
Note that every linked list is (conceptually) also a binary tree.

What makes these structures work so well recursively is their
naturally recurring instances. If a recursive program can handle one
node, then it can handle the entire tree.

So what can we do with binary trees? One useful application is sorting
indices in a "binary search tree", which is an ordered binary tree
with the following properties:

(1) Each node's left subtree contains nodes with indices less than its
    own index.

(2) Each node's right subtree contains nodes with indices greater than
    its own index.

(3) All left and right subtrees are binary search trees themselves.

(4) No two nodes have the same index.

Tree data structures like this are at the heart of every database
index, which in turn makes much of the world's commerce possible. 

The relevant theory for why this is so is covered in future courses,
but for a teaser, think about this: if you have a collection of N
elements in a linked list, and you want to see if element X is in the
list, then you need to compare X to every element in the list, a total
of N comparisons. However, if you use a binary search tree, you only
need to traverse down a single branch, and on average will make around
log_2(N) comparisons. (i.e., log-base-2 of N.) What it means to
"traverse down a single branch" will become clear as you write the
code for this assignment.

// ~ Sparse Arrays (As Data For Binary Search Trees) ~ //

You might ask, "why would I want to store values in another data
structure? Can't I already store and sort things in an array or a linked
list?"

Consider, for example, a case where you have a collection of a large
number of elements; however, most of the elements store the same value
(usually a value of 0). In a C program, a normal array of size N
occupies a contiguous piece of memory allocated for indices from 0 to
N-1. It would be inefficient to store this collection in a normal C
array because most of the memory space would be wasted repeating the
same value. What is a more efficient way to store this?

The answer is sparse array, which only stores indices with a value
different from the most common value of 0. See the comparison below:

Normal C array[100]:
   (index):  0  1  2 ... 48 49 50 51 52 ... 98 99
    value : [0, 6, 0, ... 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, ... 0, 2]

Sparse array with 100 indices:
    index: [1, 50, 99]
    value: [6,  4,  2]

So a normal C array has to store all 100 values, but a sparse array
would be able to store the exact same data with just three index-value
pairs. Compressing large amounts of redundant data like this can make
or break a computer program.

In this assignment, these index-value pairs will be stored in a binary
search tree. In theory, the index-value pairs can also be stored in a
linked list; however, binary trees are much better suited because of
their "database-index" quality, as described above.

To store a sparse array in a binary search tree, each tree node must
have two integers (the index and the value) along with pointers to the
left and right children. The binary search tree is built and sorted
based on the indices, as described above. This means that the index of
the left-child (and all of its descendants) will always be less than
the index of the current node, and the index of the right-child (and
all of its descendants) will always be greater than the index of the
current node.

// ~ Merging Two (Sparse-Array-Filled) Binary Trees ~ //

When merging two sparse array binary trees, array_1 and array_2:

(1) The contents in array_1 and array_2 should not be changed. Therefore 
    you should create a new array (called new_array) that stores the result
    of merging.

(2) Copy all the nodes in array_1 into new_array.

(3) Now we are ready to copy nodes from array_2 into new_array.
    (You will need to "iterate" over the nodes in the tree: see hints.)

(3.1) You must traverse each node in array_2 and "insert" it into new_array.
(3.2) If the index of the node you are trying to insert does not exist in new_array, then insert
      the new node normally.
(3.3) If the node's index *does* exist, then simply add the values together
      *instead* of inserting the node. But keep in mind that if the resultant
      value is 0, then the node must be removed from new_array.

Example:
Consider the following indices and corresponding values in
sparse array form (but note you will actually work in binary search tree
form in the program):

tree_1:
    index_1 = [ 1 ,  2 ,  3 ,  7 ,  8 , 9 ];
    value_1 = [ 3 ,  2 , -1 , -9 , -5 , 3 ];

tree_2:
    index_2 = [ 0 ,  1 ,  2 ,  3 , 4 , 7 , 9 ];
    value_2 = [ 5 , -3 , -8 ,  1 , 7 , 9 , 1 ];

results:
    index_3 = [ 0 ,  2 ,  4 , 8 , 9 ];
    value_3 = [ 5 , -6 ,  7 ,-5 , 4 ];
(elements whose values are zero are deleted)

// ~ Hints ~ //

(*) Make sure you read the class notes on binary trees.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

(*) You may need to write your own functions.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

(*) Even though a tree is not an array, it is still easy to "iterate"
over all of the elements. Iteration means you want to visit every
element once, and only once. You already know how to do this with an
array:

int myints[] = { 5, 3, 6, 7 };
for(ind = 0; ind < 4; ++ind)
   do_something_with(myints[ind]); // see, visit each element once and only once

With trees, you choose either pre-order, in-order, or post-order
traversal to do the same thing. You *must* know this for the exam.
Please look them up in the class notes.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

(*) If you get stuck with some cryptic bug keep in mind the discussion
of "undefined behavior" from PA02. (Go back and read this section.)
Keep in mind that your sparse-array-binary-tree data structure is
invalid if any of the following occur:

(1) The value becomes zero.
(2) The index of the left-child is >= to the index of the current node.
(3) The index of the right-child is <= to the index of the current node.

If you do *any* operation (insert, delete, etc.) on the
sparse-array-binary-tree data structure, and any of the above are
violated, then you will be in for a nasty and cryptic surprise when
writing some later function.

The best way to deal with these types of cryptic bugs is to write a
"check" function:

int SparseNode_check(SparseNode * node)
{
   // Check the above conditions here.
   // return FALSE if the node is invalid, or if there is an
   // invalid child node.
}

Call the check function before and after *every* line of code that
modifies the sparse array. This will help you pinpoint which function
is corrupting the data structure.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

(*) If you get stuck getting started, then try writing just
SparseNode_create(...), and a print_tree(...) function. You should
then be able to do the following:

// Step 1 //
Create and print trees like so:

int main(int argc, char * * argv)
{
   SparseNode * root = SparseNode_create(10, 100);
   root->left = SparseNode_create(5, 101);
   root->right = SparseNode_create(15, 102);
   root->left->right = SparseNode_create(8, 103);
   print_tree(root);
   return 0;
}

// Step 2 // 
Once you can create and print various trees (as above), then write the
check function and make sure it works. (i.e., create invalid trees and
make sure the check function picks up that they are bogus.)

// Step 3 //
Write SparseArray_destroy(...). You should now have no memory leaks or
errors.

// Step 4 //
Write SparseArray_insert(...) and use check(...) to make sure it
always works no matter what is thrown at it.

// Step 5 // 
Write SparseArray_build(...), which calls insert in a loop.

// Step 6 //
Write SparseArray_remove(...), which should work perfectly when you
remove a node with zero, one or two children. It should also work if
removing a node makes the tree empty. Use check(...) to verify that
your tree is still well formed.

At this stage you will be reasonably close to completing the assignment.
